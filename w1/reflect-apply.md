## 1. Select a specific concept, idea, or assertion made by one of the authors (Rendón and Williams Rucker in Week 1; Hogan & Sathy and Hammond in Week 2) that resonates with you in some way. Feel free to use your discussion posts as a starting point if you'd like ☺️. Please do the following for the selected concept:

> State the concept and explain it. What does it mean? Please provide references, including the page numbers.  
>
> Why did you select this concept? Why does it resonate with you?  
>
> Connect this concept to your experience in some way; it can be your educational experience or something in the classroom now. In essence, how does the concept apply to your lived experience?__

The concept of relying on students' prior knowledge in the Statistics course, as mentioned by Viji (page 2, chapter1), resonates with me. In my field of teaching computer science,  it is essential for students to fulfill the prerequisite requirements of the course. However, I often encounter students with weak prior knowledge. Initially, I used to blame the students for their lack of knowledge. Over time, I've come to realize that blaming students is not the only issue. There are other factors at play, such as educators' lack of enthusiasm in teaching the course and the failure to establish real-world connections and emphasize the importance of the subject. 
If the foundation is weak, students will struggle to build a strong knowledge base, which may lead to a loss of interest in the course, eventual withdrawal, and even a long-term dislike of the subject. It is crucial to activate students' prior knowledge before introducing new topics and to remember that motivation is the key to progress from point A to B. Without motivation and hope, 
there can be no meaningful change.

# 2. Share your main takeaways from our Zoom session led by Dr. Nydia Sánchez

> 1. Why did you select these elements? Why are they sticking with you?
> 2. What connections can you see between Dr. Sánchez's session and the readings and discussions so far? What connections can you make to your life or to our Miramar students?

# 3. Discuss one specific change you can implement from CREATE so far.

> What small modifications can you make to your classrooms or counseling sessions?
>
> Why did you select this change?
>
> Describe how you will make this change. Also remember: Both Hammond and Hogan & Sathy remind us that we do not need to revise our whole approaches to teaching and counseling right away. Instead, focus on something actionable for now, no matter how small 😀
>
> If you had to pick one quotation from Dr. Sánchez or any of the authors so far to put in a social media post or in your signature line for a week, what quotation would you highlight and why? (Bonus points if you do make a post or update your signature and share with our cohort community... but to be clear, "points" aren't really a focus in this program 😉)

I will use the Starfish story and the quote will be:

_I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples." — Mother Teresa._
